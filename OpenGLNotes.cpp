/* 
1- Vertex Specification
A vertex is a point in space, usually defined with x, y and z co-ordinates. 
Vertex Specification uses these two features:
- VAO Vertex Array Objects - position, colour, texture, normals etc.
- VBO defines data itself
- Attribute pointers define where and how shaders can access vertex data.

Procedure through Code:
1- Generate a VAO ID
2- Bind the VAO with that ID
3- Generate a VBO ID
4- Bind the VBO with that ID, attaching VBO to VAO
5- Attach the vertex data to that VBO
6- Define the Attribute Pointer formatting
7- Enable the Attribute Pointer
8- Unbind the VAO and VBO, ready for the next object to be bound

** This procedure was used in triangle formations.

1- Activate Shader Program you want to use
2- Bind the VAO of object you want to draw
3- Call glDrawArrays, which initiates the rest of the pipeline

Vertex Shader handles vertices individually.
Stores data in gl_Position.
Fragment Shaders handles data for each fragment.

// Vectors, Matrices and Uniform Variables

/*
GLm is used at OpenGL math operations, most importantly vectors and matrices.
Uniform variables pass global data to shaders.
Need to obtain a uniform's location then bind data to it.

glm:mat4 model;
glm::mat4 model(1.0f)
Correction on mat 4 using GLM.

OpenGL transformations should be used by the right order.
If we move something and then rotate it, it will be rotating based on the or the point of the origin point as opposed to its own origin.

Transform functions are:
model = glm::translate(model, glm::vec3(triOffset, triOffset/2, 0.0f));
model = glm::rotate(model, currentAngle * toRadians, glm::vec3(0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f));
model = glm::scale(model, glm::vec3(currentSize, currentSize, 1.0f));
*/

//////////////////////////// 

// Interpolation, Indexed Draws and Projections

/*
Vertex attributes are interpolated using other values on the primitive.
Weighted average of the three vertices on a triangle is passed on.
Fragment shader uses interpolated values.

Indexed Draws:
1- Define vertices to draw a cube.
2- Cube will consist of 12 triangles, two for each face.
3- 12 x 3 vertices per triangle = 36 vertices.
4- But a cube has 8 vertices.
5- Some vertices will be used multiple times.

Projections
1- User to convert from "View Space" to "Clip Space".
2- Can be used to give the scene a '3D' look through depth.
3- Alternatively can be used to create 2D style for projects.
4- Works on coordinate systems.

Local space: raw position of each vertex relative to origin.
World space: position of vertex in the world itself if came is assumed to be position at the origin.
View space: position of vertex in the world relative to camera position and orientation.
Clip space: position of vertex in the world relative to the came position and orientation, as viewed in the are not to be "clipped" from the final output.
Screen space: after clipping takes place, final image is created and placed.

- Orthographic Projection used in 2D Applications
- Perspective Projection used in 3D Applications

glm::mat4 proj = glm::perspective(fov, aspect, near, far)
fov => field of view,
aspect => aspect ratio of the viewport
near => distance of the near plane
far => distance of the far plane
Bind the given matrix to a uniform in the shade as:
gl_position = projection * view * model * vec (pos, 1.0)
*/

//////////////////////////// 

/*
Camera/View Space

Camera processes the scene as seen in "View Space".
View space is the coordinate system with each vertex as seen from the camera.
Use a View matrix to convert from World Space to View Space
Required 4 values:
- Camera Position
- Direction
- Right
- Up

Camera position: position of the camera.
direction: the direction camera is looking in.
direction vector points in opposite direction of the intuitive direction.

Right means multiply camera by cross product of [0, 1, 0]
Up means multiply camera by cross product of Direction and right vectors.

glm::mat4 viewMatrix;
glm::lookAt(position, target, up)

to use view Matrix: 
1- bind it to a uniform on the shader.
2- Apply it between the projection and model matrices.
3- Order in shader matters, usually projection - view - model.

Input: Moving the Camera

GLFW: glfw GetKey(window, GLFW_KEY_W)
Add the value to camera position while key held.
To fix computer speeds and track it by fps:

Input: Delta Time
Check how much time passed since last loop, apply maths based on this to keep consistent speeds.

deltaTime = currentTime - lastTime;
lastTime = currentTime;

Input: Turning

Angles for turning:
- Pitch: looking up and down (axis relative to the yaw)
- Yaw: looking left and right (around x-axis)
- Roll: like a plane doing a barrel roll

Input: Turning- Pitch
y = sin(pitch);
x = cos(pitch);
z = cos(pitch);

Input: Turning- Yaw
x = cos(yaw);
z = sin(yaw);

GLFW: glfwSetCursorPosCallback (window, callback);
Store old mouse position, compare to new position, Use diff to decide pitch/yaw change.

/*
Textures

Textures are images used to add extra detail to an object. Textures can also be used to hold generic data.
Usually 2D but can also have 1D and 3D textures.
Points on textures are texels, not pixels. Texels are defined between 0 and 1, bound to vertices with interpolated values.

To sample a point at the top-middle you reference texel (0.5,1).
Map texels to vertices. Interpolation over each fragment will calculate appropriate texels in between the assigned texels.

glGenTextures (1, &texture);
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texture);
- Different type of textures for 1D and 3D

glTexImage2D (GL_TEXTURE2D, 0, GL_RGB, width, height, 0, GL_RGB, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, data)

- Texture target.
- Mipmap level, resolution limitations for textures, handling level of detail.
Create multiple version of image at different resolutions and switch when needed.
- Format of stored data. RGB is red green blue. Also RGBA which has alpha channel, transparency.
- Width and height of the texture with 4 and 5.
- Texture borders, always 0.
- Format of the loaded data (not stored).
- The data type of the values.
- The data itself.

Texture parameters:
Render off center of texels ?
- Nearest - use the texel with most overlap
- Linear - Use a weighted average of surrounding texels

glTexParameteri (GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_LINEAR);
glTexParameteri (GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, GL_LINEAR);

Texture filtering changes how texels are blended
Nearest to give more pixelated look, linear to give more blended look;
Outside (0,1) range;
- Repeat the texture,
- Repeat a mirrored form of the texture,
- Extend pixels at the edge,
- Apply a coloured border.
glTexParameter helps with this.

Texture wrapping changes how textures are handled for texel values outside 0,1.
GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S > Wrapping on x-axis
GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T > Wrapping on y-axis

GL_REPEAT: Repeat texture.
GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT: Repeat and mirror texture.
GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE: Extend pixels at edge.
GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER: Apply coloured border.

Image loader libraries:
SOIL Library (Simple OpenGL Image Library)
stb_image
#define STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION
unsigned char* data=
stbi_load("image.jpg", &width, &height, &bitDepth, 0);
Might need to flip image.
stbi_set_flip_vertically_on_load(true);

- Texture in Shaders are accessed via "Samplers" with IDs.
- Textures are attached to a "Texture Unit".
- Samplers access textures attached to their Texture Unit.
- In shader, use "sampler2D" type.
- To get the value of a texel, use GLSL "texture" function.
- texture(textureSampler, TexCoord);
- textureSampler: the sampler2D Object.
- TexCoord: interpolated texel coordinate in fragment shader.

Bind texture to desired Texture Unit:
- glActiveTexture (GL_TEXTURE0);
- glBindTexture (GL_TEXTURE_2D, textureID);
Ensure sampler2D variables know which Texture Unit to access:
- glUniform1i(uniformTextureSampler, 0);
Value attached to Uniform is the Texture Unit Number.

Textures can be retrieved from Texturer.com

/*
Phong Lighting and Directional Lights

- Ambient Lighting: Always present light, even if blocked.
- Diffuse Lighting: Light determined by direction of light source. Faded effect further from light.
- Specular Lighting: Light reflected from the source to the viewers eyes. 
Combination of all three is "Phong Lighting Model".

Ambient Lighting :
- Simulates light bouncing off other objects.
- Global illumination simulates this.
- Create an ambient lighting factor.
ambient = lightColour * ambientStrength;
- This factor is how much of a fragment's colour this light's ambient shows.
fragColour = objectColour * ambient;
- If ambient is 1, fully lit, 0, then is black, 0.5, half its normal colour.

Diffuse Lighting:
- Simulates the drop-off of lightning as angle of lighting becomes more shallow.
- Side facing directly at a light is brightly lit.
- Side facging at an angle is more dim.
- Can use angle between vector connecting to light source to fragment and the vector perpendicular to the face (surface "normal");
- Diffuse factor should be determined based on angle in between, which can be found with dot product.
v1 . v2 output determines diffuse factor.
- If diffuse factory is negative (less than 0), then light is behind surface so default to 0.
fragColour = objectColour * (ambient + diffuse)

Defining normals;
- Could be done for each face. 
- Each vertex will have multiple normals, one for each face it is part of.
- Good for "Flat Shading", not good for realistic smooth shading.
- Also does not work too well for indexed draws: we only define each vertex once per face.

Phong Shading:
- Each vertex has an average of the normals of the all the surfaces it is part of.
- Interpolate between these averages in shader to create smooth effect.
- Good for complex models.
- Not so good for simple models with sharp edges.
- Phong shaded sphere is defined the same way as Flat Shaded.
- Smoothness interpolates averaged normals to create smooth surfaces.
Transform normals with mat3(transpose(inverse(model)))

Specular Lighting:
- Relies on the possition of the viewer.
- It is the direct reflection of the light source hitting the viewer's eye.
- Moving around will affect the apparent position of the specular reflection on the surface.
Needed four things:
- Light vector
- Normal vector
- Reflection vector (light vector reflected around Normal)
- View vector (vector from viewer to fragment)

- View vector is the difference between fragment position and the viewer (Camera) position.
- Reflection vector can be obtained with a built in GLSL function: reflect (incident, normal)
- Incident : vector to reflect
- Normal : normal vector to reflect around
- Use dot product of normalized forms

Specular Lighting - Shininess
- More accurate reflection
- simply put previously calculated specular factor to the power of shininess value.
specularFactor = (view . reflection)^shininess;
fragColour = objectColour * (ambient+diffuse+specular);

Types of light:
- Directional light: a light without a position or source. All light is coming as parallel rays from an seeminly infinite distance. Sunlight.
- Point light: a light with a position that shines in all directions. Lightbulb.
- Spot light: similar to point light but cut down to emit in a certain range with a certain angle. Flashlight.
- Area light: more advances light type that emits light from an area. Large light up panel on a wall or ceiling.

Directional light:
- Simplest form of light.
- requires basic information of colour, ambient, diffuse, specular and a direction.
- treat all calculations using the same direction.

*/

//////////////////////////// 

/*

Point Lights
- Lights with a position that emit light in ALL directions.
- Need to determine direction vector manually.
- Get difference between light position and fragment position.
- Apply directional lighting maths to the calculated direction vector.

Value of Attenuation
- Point light has positions and distance from point being lit changes power of lighting.
- Linear drop-off.
- Light intensity initially drops quickly with a distance.
- Further object is, slower it decreases.
- Quadratic function can create this effect for positive values.
1 / (ax2 + bx +c)
- Where x is the distance between light source and the fragment.
- Where a is the user-defined value, usually the lowest of all three.
- Where b is the user-defined value, lower than constant.
- Where c is the constant, usually 1 to ensure denominator is always greater than 1.

Spot Lights
- Direction where the spot light is facing.
- Cut-off angle: The angle describing the "edges" of light from the direction vector.
angletoFragment: lightVector * lightDirection
light Vector: The vector from the light to the fragment.
light Direction: The direction the Spot Light is facing.
- angletoFragment will be a value between 0 and 1, representing the angle between the two.
cos(cutOffAngle)
- Larger the value, smaller the angle, and vice versa.
- If angletoFragment value > cos(cutOffAngle); Apply Lighting(); else; Don't apply lighting.
- Edges must be softened instead of this black-white situation.
- Solution - Scale dot product range to 0-1 !
SpotLightFade = 1- (1-angletoFragment)/(1-cutOffAngle);
colour = spotLightColour * spotLightFade;

/*

Shadow Mapping
- Literally create a "map" of the shadows made by light to determine where not to apply light.
- Held as 2D Texture (sampler2D in shader).
- Map is created using a "Framebuffer", which then writes it to texture.
- At least two rendering passes needed, one for shadow map creation, one for drawing scene.

1) Render the scene from perspective of a light source
2) Define if that point can be seen

- Pre-Sample Operations with depth tests, using depth buffer values.
- Depth buffer is another buffer along with colour buffer that holds a value between 0 and 1 and determines how deep in to frustrum a fragment is.
- 0 is near plane (close to camera), 1 is far plane (far from camera).

- To extract depth buffer data, framebuffer object is used.
- Framebuffer is 0 in default.
- A third seperate framebuffer to keep shadow frames between two buffers.

glGenFramebuffers (1, &FBO);
glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT, width, height, 0, GL_DEPTH COMPONENT, GL_FLOAT, NULL);
GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT: Single GLfloat value, unlike RGB, which was glm:vec3.
- Data is NULL so we create an empty texture with dimensions width x height.
- Set framebuffer to write texture with:
glFramebufferTexture2D (GL_FRAMEBUFFER, GL_DEPTH_ATTACHMENT, GL_TEXTURE_2D, textureID, 0);
GL_DEPTH_aTTACHMENT: tells frambuffer to only write depth buffer data.
glDrawBuffer(GL_NONE);
glReadBuffer(GL_NONE);
- These override colour data draw/read operations. We do not want to output colour with our shadow map!

- Apply projection and view matrices as if light source is the camera.
- Apply model matrix of each object.
- Fragment shader not needed, depth buffer written automatically.
- Difference between direcitonal light and point/spot light shadow maps.
- View matrix position should consist of reverse of Directional light's direction, which is direction of the light.
- Projection matrix is different. Dİrectional Light rays all parallel.
glm::ortho(-20.0f, -20.0f, -20.0f, -20.0f, 0.01f, 100.0f);
- Texture is bound with shadow map data, unbind the framebuffer and bind the texture to our main shader for use.

- Perspective divide to convert them into normalized device coordinates.
- Divide vector by its w component, so vec4.
vec3 projCoords = LightSpacePos.xyz / LightSpacePos.w;
projCoords = (projCoords * 0.5) + 0.5; (to scale 1-0)
- Texture function gets closest depth measured during Shadow Map pass.
float closest = texture (shadowMap, projCoords.xy).r;
- z value from projCoords is between 0 and 1 just like depth.
- Compare current and closest depth. If current larger than closest: Further away from the first point so must be in shadow.
- Otherwise same point, so gets hit by light.
colour = fragColour * (ambient + (1.0 - shadow) * (diffuse + specular));

Shadow Acne
- Shadow Acne occurs due to resolution issues.
- When rendering from a less slanted angle, two pixels may converge to one texel on the shadow map.
- We add a slight bias to fix this.
- Moving everything slightly towards the camera to fake a closer depth.

Oversampling
- What about areas outside the Projection frustum used to create the shadow map ?
- Always create shadows since values are outside the range 0,1.
- Set texture type to use border with values all consisting of 0 (always lowest depth value so always lit).
- For values beyond far plane and therefore greater than 1: Initialize to 0.

PCF (Percentage CLoser Filtering)
- Edge of shadows are limited to resolution of texture shadow map.
- Unsightly pixelated edges.
- Sample surrounding texels and calculate average. 
- Apply on partial shadows for shadowed areas.
- GEt depth values of surrounding texels, determine if in shadow.
- If yes, Increment shadow value, divide shadow value by number of samples taken, apply percentage of shadow.
shadow value is 3, 9 samples are taken, 3/9 = 0.333, so apply %33 shadow.
- More samples, better fade effect.
- set of samples are taken for EVERY fragment, so its not one calculation, its 9 calculations for using immediate surrounding texels.
