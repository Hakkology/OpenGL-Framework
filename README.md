# OpenGL-Framework
Making a Game Engine with OpenGL using VSCode on Ubuntu Dist.


The work took a similar approach to Dane Cook's OpenGL course but since i am building this up on Ubuntu, i had to take different approaches to find workable solutions. Some factors were easier to implement and others were a lot more difficult.
My first attempt in utilizing C++ with openGL Framework is in this repository. Tasks completed are as follows:

- Creation of a window and initiating GLEW and GLFW.
- Creation of a triangle on a 2D Window using GLEW and GLFW.
- Integration of GLM (OpenGL maths library) for matrix operations.
- Transforming objects in terms of translation, rotation and scaling.
- Creation of a 3D pyramid using indices and vertices with Mesh class.
- Addition of Camera and User Input with GLFW.
- Camera Controls and escape button to close the graphics window.
- Texture and Image loading and texture mapping.
- Phong Lighting Model, analyzing ambient, diffuse and specular lighting.
- Point lights and spot lights.
- Importing 3D Models with proper textures.
- Shadow Mapping.
- Directional and Omnidirectional Shadow Maps, Cube Maps and the Geometry Shader.
- Adding a Skybox using the cubemap.

There is much more inside the code aside from these headers. However, i plan to improve this as follows:

- Code Refactoring (Need to polish on my C++ first).
- Additional features related to game development such as Collision detection algorithms.
- Analyze the code and take what is needed to create a 2D game.
- Additional features using Dear Imgui UI library to start the engine works.
- Make at least one 2D game using this library.

There is also much more to be done, but im proud where it got so far.
Feel free to make comments and contact me if you have any ideas related to it.
